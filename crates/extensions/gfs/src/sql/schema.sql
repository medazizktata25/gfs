-- SOURCE DRIFT GUARD ---------------------------------------------------------
-- A copy-on-read clone fetches each table the FIRST time it is read, so tables
-- arrive at different moments. That is only safe while the source holds still.
-- If the source is written to during the clone's life, the clone mixes tables
-- captured at different points in time, producing a state that never existed at
-- the source (e.g. 1,000,000 orders but payments for 1,050,000).
--
-- Postgres cannot cheaply serve "this table AS OF clone time" for a long-lived
-- clone, so this cannot be PREVENTED on a live primary. It can be DETECTED.
-- Everything below is OBSERVATION ONLY: it never touches the read path, so it
-- cannot change the result of any query.
--
-- Detection uses three signals, with deliberately different trust levels:
--   * WAL position   -- NEVER misses a change (safe), but cannot attribute it.
--   * write counters -- attribute change to a table, but MISS truncate/rewrite.
--   * schema digests -- the only way to see DDL (it moves no row counter).
-- Hence the load-bearing rule: WAL moved but nothing attributed means
-- "changed, unattributed" and every materialized table is suspect. It must
-- never be read as "nothing changed".
-- FROZEN / DETACHED STATE (#132) ---------------------------------------------
-- A frozen clone is a sealed point-in-time snapshot: gfs.freeze_run() re-copied
-- every non-diverged table from ONE source instant and detached the clone. From
-- then on NOTHING contacts the source: the planner hook serves every registered
-- table locally (route.rs consults CloneInfo.frozen), the background worker
-- drops upkeep jobs, and source_drift/refresh_drift_state/pull/resync_table/warm
-- all no-op or refuse. Single row, same hot-switch pattern as gfs.cost/budget.

-- COPY WATERMARKS (#131) ------------------------------------------------------
-- Drift (the source moved since clone time) is NOT tornness (this clone mixes
-- data copied at different source moments). The two disagree in both directions:
--   * a pull re-anchors the baseline and resets only the FLAGGED tables, so a
--     clone can be genuinely torn while source_drift() reports a quiet source;
--   * a clone whose tables were all copied at ONE moment, after which the
--     source moved, is coherent-but-stale, not torn.
-- Tornness is therefore recorded at the only place it is knowable: the copy
-- event itself. Every hydration/warm stamps the table with WHERE THE SOURCE WAS
-- when its rows arrived, making "this clone spans WAL X..Y" a computable,
-- source-free fact instead of a guess.
--
-- Moment identity follows the same three-signal doctrine as the drift guard:
-- the WAL position never misses a change but cannot tell housekeeping from a
-- real write (an idle server advances its own WAL -- the #140 lesson), so two
-- copy events are "the same moment" when the source-wide row-activity totals
-- match; the LSN decides only when the totals are unusable (the stats-lost
-- source measured in #131's sibling work), flagged via lsn_only.
--
-- Chunked tables (int/time range keys) get a MIN..MAX span and a moment count,
-- not per-row provenance: range coalescing merges chunks and ON CONFLICT DO
-- NOTHING keeps older row versions silently, so which ROW is from which moment
-- is unknowable without invasive per-row columns. The span is the honest ceiling.

-- Writable by PUBLIC: the per-clone bookkeeping the planner hook maintains in
-- the *invoker's* context. The hook (lib.rs's gfs_planner) does this work both
-- as raw SPI in the Rust extension (route.rs / hydrate.rs / catalog.rs write
-- clone_source, cached_predicate, clone_stats and copy_queue directly) and
-- through plain LANGUAGE plpgsql functions below that are not SECURITY DEFINER
-- (gfs.note_range -> cached and, via gfs.note_copy, copy_watermark;
-- gfs.refresh_drift_state -> drift_state + drift_notes; gfs.pull ->
-- source_baseline; the gfs.note_tombstone AFTER DELETE trigger -> tombstone).
-- All of that runs as whatever role executed the intercepted query, so a plain
-- SELECT against a cloned table from a non-superuser fails closed without
-- these ("permission denied for table clone_source" via bump_access, then
-- "... for table cached", then "... for table drift_state" -- found one table
-- at a time live-testing a lazy clone against a real remote source).

-- Deliberately NOT granted for write: gfs.cost, gfs.budget, gfs.sync_policy
-- and gfs.clone_mode. Those are the policy/limit knobs, not bookkeeping, and
-- changing a setting is the owner's to do. Nothing on the hook's invoker path
-- writes them: gfs.cost is written only by gfs.calibrate() and gfs.clone_mode only by
-- gfs.freeze_run(), neither of which the Rust hook ever calls; gfs.sync_policy
-- is never written by any function (it is set by hand by the owner); and
-- gfs.budget is written only by gfs.take_token(), which is already SECURITY
-- DEFINER precisely so a low-privilege caller can drive it without holding
-- write access -- the pattern RFC 008 documents for exactly this problem.
-- Granting write on gfs.budget would let a clone's own role `DELETE FROM
-- gfs.budget`, which makes take_token()'s `rate IS NULL` branch return 0 and
-- permanently disables the token bucket that protects the upstream production
-- source.
